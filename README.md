# Flutter Application Starter Templates

This repository contains two complete Flutter starter templates:

1. **Clean (Layered) Architecture**
2. **MVVM Architecture**

Both are production-ready starter structures designed to help developers quickly bootstrap new applications without manually creating folders and boilerplate setup.

---
## ⚡ Prefer an Automatic Setup?

This repository explains how to implement Flutter MVVM and Clean Architecture **manually**.
If you want a faster, one-command setup, use the official package on pub.dev:

👉 **[arch_starters](https://pub.dev/packages/arch_starters)**
Automatically generates complete architecture structures without the manual steps shown below.

---

## Purpose

Developers often need to create new applications with proper architectural foundations. This repository provides pre-structured templates that can be directly extracted into the `lib/` directory of a new Flutter project.

You can choose which architecture you want to start with and import it instantly using terminal commands.

# Installing and Using

## Prerequisites

* Flutter and Dart installed
* A new Flutter project already created
* You must run commands while standing inside the `root/` of your new project

Example:

```shell
cd my_new_flutter_project/
```

---

# Command (Terminal, Windows/macOS/Linux)

## Extracting the Clean Architecture Template


### Download repo zip
```shell
curl -L https://github.com/Ahmed-lashari/Architecture-Starters/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o starter.zip
```
### Extract only clean folder to temp folder
```shell
unzip starter.zip "Architecture-Starters-main/clean/*" -d temp
```

### Copy contents of clean into current project root
```shell
cp -r temp/Architecture-Starters-main/clean/* ./
```

### Clean up
```shell
rm -rf temp starter.zip
```

---

## Extracting the MVVM Architecture Template

### Download repo zip
```shell
curl -L https://github.com/Ahmed-lashari/Architecture-Starters/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o starter.zip
```

### Extract only mvvm folder to temp folder
```shell
unzip starter.zip "Architecture-Starters-main/mvvm/*" -d temp
```

### Copy contents of mvvm into current project root
```shell
cp -r temp/Architecture-Starters-main/mvvm/* ./
```

### Clean up
```shell
rm -rf temp starter.zip
```


This will overrite everything inside `mvvm/lib/` or `mvvm/lib/` into your project’s `lib/` folder.

# Which Architecture Should I Choose

### MVVM

* Suitable for small to medium scale apps
* Easier and faster to get started
* Less code split, simpler structure

### Clean Architecture

* Highly scalable and maintainable
* Strict separation of layers
* Recommended for large or enterprise applications
